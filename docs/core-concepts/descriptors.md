# Descriptors

Rather than using `customElements.define()` explicitly, the library provides own `define` function (with similar API), which under the hood calls Custom Element API after all (read more in [Definition](./definition.md) section). 

The most important benefit is that we have all control over the input of the custom element definition. We can create class wrapper constructor dynamically and apply properties on its prototype so that the descriptor structure can be custom. The hybrids heavily use that pattern to provide its unique features. The component definition as a map of property descriptors applied on the prototype of the constructor.

The "descriptor" name came from the third argument of the `Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)` method, which is used to set those descriptors on the `prototype` of the custom element constructor.

## Structure

A shape of the descriptor is similar to what `Object.defineProperty()` requires for defining getter/setter property:

```javascript
const MyElement = {
  propertyName: {
    get: (host, lastValue) => { ... },
    set: (host, value, lastValue) => { ... },
    connect: (host, key, invalidate) => {
      ...
      return () => { ... }; // disconnect
    },
  },
};
```

However, there are a few differences. First of all, instead of using function context (`this` keyword), the first argument of all methods is the instance of an element. It allows using arrow functions and destructuring function arguments.

The second most significant change is the cache mechanism, which controls and holds current property value. By the specs, getter/setter property requires external variable for keeping the value. In the hybrids, cache covers that for you.

**Despite the [factories](factories.md) and [translation](translation.md) concepts, you can always define properties using descriptors**. The only requirement is that your definition has to include at least one of the `get` or `set` methods. `connect` can be omitted. If you set only `set`, `get` defaults to a function, which returns last cached value.

The following sections describe more deeply available properties in the descriptor.

### Get

```typescript
get: (host: Element, lastValue: any) => {
  // calculate next value
  const nextValue = ...;

  // return it
  return nextValue;
}
```

* **arguments**:
  * `host` - an element instance
  * `lastValue` - last cached value of the property
* **returns (required)**:
  * `nextValue` - a value of the current state of the property

`get` method calculates current property value. The returned value is cached by default. This method is called again only if other properties defined by the library used in the body of the function have changed. Cache mechanism uses equality check to compare values (`nextValue !== lastValue`), so it enforces using immutable data, which is one of the ground rules of the library.

In the following example `get` method of the `name` property is called again if `firstName` or `lastName` has changed:

```javascript
const MyElement = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  name: {
    get: ({ firstName, lastName }) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
  },
};

console.log(myElement.name); // calls 'get' and returns 'John Smith'
console.log(myElement.name); // Cache returns 'John Smith'
```

### Set

```typescript
set: (host: Element, value: any, lastValue: any) => {
  // calculate next value
  const nextValue = ...;

  // return it
  return nextValue;
}
```

* **arguments**:
  * `host` - an element instance
  * `value` - a value passed to assertion (ex., `el.myProperty = 'new value'`)
  * `lastValue` - last cached value of the property
* **returns (required)**: 
  * `nextValue` - a value of the property, which replaces cached value

Every assertion of the property calls `set` method (like `myElement.property = 'new value'`). Cache value is invalidated if returned `nextValue` is not equal to `lastValue`. Only if cache invalidates `get` method is called. 

However, `set` method doesn't call `get` immediately. The next access to the property calls `get` method despite the fact, that `set` returned a new value. It means, that `get` method takes this value as the `lastValue` argument, use it to calculate `nextValue` and return it.

The following example shows `power` property using the default `get`, and `set` method, which calculates the power of the number passed to the property:

```javascript
const MyElement = {
  power: {
    set: (host, value) => value ** value,
  },
}

myElement.power = 10; // calls 'set' method and set cache to 100
console.log(myElement.power); // Cache returns 100
```

If your property value only depends on other properties from the component, you can omit `set` method and use cache mechanism for holding property value (use only `get` method).

### Connect & Disconnect

```typescript
connect: (host: Element, key: string, invalidate: Function) => {
  // attach event listeners, etc...
  cb = () => {...};
  host.addEventListener('transitionend', cb);

  // return disconnect callback
  return () => {
    // clean up listeners
    host.removeEventListener('transitionend', cb);
  }
}
```

* **arguments**:
  * `host` - an element instance
  * `key` - a property key name
  * `invalidate` - a callback function, which invalidates cached value
* **returns (not required):**
  * `disconnect` - a function (without arguments)

Whenever you insert, remove or relocate an element in the DOM tree, `connect` or `disconnect` is called synchronously (by the `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback` callbacks of the Custom Elements API).

You can use `connect` to attach event listeners, initialize property value (using `key` argument) and many more. To clean up subscriptions return a `disconnect` function, where you remove attached listeners and other things.

## Change detection

```javascript
myElement.addEventListener('@invalidate', () => { ...});
```

When property cache value invalidates, change detection mechanism dispatches `@invalidate` custom event  (composed and bubbling), which allows observing changes of the element properties. The event is dispatched implicit when you set new value by the assertion or explicit by calling `invalidate` in `connect` callback. The event type was chosen to avoid name collision with those created by the custom elements authors.

If the third party code is responsible for the property value, you can use `invalidate` callback to update it and trigger change detection. For example, it can be used to connect to async web APIs or external libraries:

```javascript
import reduxStore from './store';

const MyElement = {
  name: {
    get: () => reduxStore.getState().name,
    connect: (host, key, invalidate) => reduxStore.subscribe(invalidate),
  },
};
```

In the above example, a cached value of `name` property invalidates if `reduxStore` changes. However, the `get` method is called if you access the property.
