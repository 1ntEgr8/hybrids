# Iteration

For iteration, an expression should return an `array` with a list of expressions. Items can be primitive values, nested templates as well as nested arrays.

```javascript
html`
  <todo-list>
    ${names.map((name) => `Name: ${name}`)}

    ${items.map(({ name }) => html`<todo-item>${name}</todo-item>`)}
  </todo-list>
`;
```

## Keys

For default, array `index` identifies expressions for re-render. However, you can use `key` method provided by the result of `html` call for efficient re-order (it sets key and returns update function). If a list changes and key is found, existing template is updated rather than thew new one is created.

```javascript
html`
  <todo-list>
    ${items.map(({ id, name }) => 
      html`<todo-item>${name}</todo-item>`.key(id),
    )}
  </todo-list>
`
```
