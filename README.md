#### Hybrids is a toolkit for creating web components using [Custom Elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/), [Template](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-templates/) and [Shadow DOM](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/) specifications. 

The main goal of the library is to create simple and easy to use API. The name is taken from the *hybrid architecture*, which is one of the core concepts of the project.

## Key features

* Component logic decoupled from custom element prototype 
* Code encapsulation with flexible public access
* Element's attribute and property mapping with automatic type reflection
* Modular structure extendable by functional plugins
* Injectable helper functions for listen and dispatch events, tree traversing and more
